## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This project use the UCI HAR Dataset to build a new tidy dataset, applying the tools and techniques see in Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The run_analysis script containt:
- Call libraries
- Two functions: 
 - get_measurement function: Get the mean and standar deviation from UCI HAR train and test dataframe.
 - set_label_factor: Change the number of the activity to factor label.
 
Next, you can see the five steps define in the project to 
1. Merge dataframe
2. Calculate mean and sd from raw data
3. Rename activities
4. Rename dataframe labels
5. Get new tidy dataframe
